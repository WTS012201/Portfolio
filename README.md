# Introduction
Currently an undergrad student in my senior year working towards my Bachelors in Computer Science. Topics I've recently been interested in include computer vision, AI, and machine learning. I have been focused in expanding my knowledge in these areas in the past year.

# Projects

* Created a lightweight tool that lets you extract text from an image efficiently

* Worked with a team of five to create a fitness app for android
* Used an agile development process by creating requirements, models and diagrams, coding, and making changes incrementally
* Practiced version control using a remote repository through github
* Our team used android studio for developing the app

# Currently working on
For my senior design, me any my team plan on making a social fishing app. 

The app will allow users to input various details about their catch and upload it to the platform. Detailed input fields will include a picture of the fish, the weight, length, the location, species, bait used, date caught, etc. To make fishing more rewarding, our app will also include a mission and reward system. Users will have a menu on their profile that will display fishing related missions. The social feature is structured similar to how a forum works and serves as a way for users to get together as a community and talk about anything fish related. Users can create a new discussion post and other users can interact in the discussion.
