# Introduction

I'm an undergraduate student in my senior year working towards my Bachelors in Computer Science. I have a strong interest in computer vision and machine learning in computer vision. I have been focused in expanding my knowledge in these areas for the past year.

# Education

- B.S. in Computer Science, University of Texas at Arlington, expected graduation May 2023
- GPA: 3.5
- Notable Coursework: Intro to Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, Object Oriented Programming, Intro to Software Engineering, and Operating Systems

# Projects

# [Project 1: Text Extraction Tool](https://github.com/WTS012201/Text-Extraction-Tool)

- Created a lightweight tool for extracting text from an image efficiently
- This tool also allows the user to change the text in an image including the font, font size, and color
- I used OpenCV with Tesseract for OCR with Qt for the user interface

# Currently working on

For my senior design, me any my team plan on making a social fishing app.

The app will allow users to input various details about their catch and upload it to the platform. Detailed input fields will include a picture of the fish, the weight, length, the location, species, bait used, date caught, etc. To make fishing more rewarding, our app will also include a mission and reward system. Users will have a menu on their profile that will display fishing related missions. The social feature is structured similar to how a forum works and serves as a way for users to get together as a community and talk about anything fish related. Users can create a new discussion post and other users can interact in the discussion.

# Skills

- Languages: C, C++, Python, Javascript, Typescript, and Java
- Familiar with: HTML, CSS, ReactJS, NodeJS, Graphql, PostgreSQL, Linux, Git, Scrum/Agile methodologies, Qt, Jupyter, OpenCV, Pointcloud, Tensorflow, PyTorch, and Android Studio
